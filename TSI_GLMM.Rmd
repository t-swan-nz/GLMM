Comparison of the two models
```{r}
#compare the residuals between models

#negative binomial - residuals 1062
sum(residuals(albo_n_b,"pearson")^2)

#binomial - residuals 1788
sum(residuals(albo_binomial,"pearson")^2)

#compare AIC weights between models:

AIC(albo_binomial, albo_n_b)

#the binomial model has the lower AIC weight.

#Compare the R2 between different models

#negative binomial
albo_n_b_R2

#binomial
albo_binomial_R2

#CONCLUSION 

#the binomial model has the lowest AIC weights, but the highest residuals. I think it might be a better fit for the data, considering the results from DHARMa in finding the QQ plot distribution test, dispersion test and outlier tests to be not significant. These tests were significant for the negative binomial model (not great).
